                                A Primer will never try to intimidate you or do small talk. It's opinionated without being pushy, principled without being self-righteous, intellectual without being academic, artful without being snobby. After encountering a Primer, you leave with new perspectives to weigh, new names to remember, new ideas to latch onto, new questions.

                        In this volume, we're offering a primer exploring our understandings of space:
                        the areas we traverse, the rooms we occupy, the sites where we live, and love, and define ourselves.
