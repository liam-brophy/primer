    content: `She saw the first bug in the kitchen cabinet.

It was small, its pinprick head poking out from behind a dinner plate, antennae bending
toward her like cattails by a pond. It gave her the creeps. But before she could smash it
with a piece of paper towel, it disappeared back into the dark.

For weeks, she didn't see another. She convinced herself that it had been a fluke — some
little crawly that had gotten in from the fire escape. Then, midway through December,
she opened the utensil drawer to find another bug identical to the first: thumbnail-sized,
sandy brown, with a white stripe behind its head. It was quick, but she managed to
crush it with the end of a box of Saran wrap. She nudged its limp body into the trash.

The girl liked living alone. She liked not needing to think about whether the bathroom
would be available when she had to pee. She liked keeping the apartment neat, the
books level and alphabetized, and the bathroom counter free of smudges. Every Sunday,
she wiped down surfaces — the coffee table, the bookshelves, the windowsills — and
vacuumed, dragging neat stripes across the checkerboard rug. Every other Sunday, she
washed her sheets and lint-rolled the curtains.

Her favorite room in the apartment was the kitchen. Given that the apartment had only
four rooms, this wasn't saying much. Still, she found herself gravitating toward the
space to spy out of the two tall windows overlooking the building's backyard, or to
shuffle things around in the fridge, or to make a cup of tea and sit at the faux marble
island. This kitchen was a proper room, far from the glorified hallway of her previous
apartment: a stove smashed up to a counter with a fridge squeezed in. It faced north so
there was no direct sunlight, but at the right hour of the day — around noon or 1 p.m. — it lit up with a glow like the castoff from a neon sign.

When she'd toured the apartment, the kitchen had caught the girl's attention with its
pale tile floor and glossy wooden cabinets. She found in it a form of fantasy. She had
never been a particularly enthusiastic cook; mealtimes were an annoyance, her body
once again reminding her that it existed and needed things. But in the room the broker
showed her, plain and stark as it was before she'd added sage-green paint and a peg board
and rows of plants, she saw herself moving around, immersed in chopping or washing or
stirring in a way that she thought might feel like floating. After she moved in, she paid
special attention to the room, vacuuming the floor and wiping down the counters not
weekly but every night.

The idea, then, that untold numbers of small brown bugs might also live in her kitchen
was intolerable. They were easy enough to ignore during the day while they hid in
their crevices. But after sundown, she'd flip on the kitchen light to find half a dozen
circling the cat's food bowl. These varied in size so much that at first she thought they
might be different species. The smallest bug was barely bigger than a pinhead; the
medium-sized ones were about the length of her thumbnail; the largest ran the
length of the tip of her thumb to her first knuckle. The last were faster, more agile, and
smarter. If her shadow fell over them, they would race to the nearest crack between
counter and floor.

It was the evening she opened her trashcan and saw three of the largest bugs skittering
around the lid that finally convinced her to do some Googling. She typed:
brown beetle
small brown beetle NYC
fast brown beetle
brown bug white stripe

Page after page turned up photos she didn't recognize: carpet beetles, earwigs. Finally,
on a site called "Pestworld.org," she found what she was looking for: brown bug, white
stripe, a life cycle that explained all the variants she'd come to know. Her bugs were German cockroaches.

The German cockroach is different from the American, which is rust-brown and can
grow an inch and a half or more in length. Commonly called "water bugs," American
roaches like the dark and damp and often crawl into homes through plumbing. They
also, the girl read with a shudder, have wings; some species can fly. German
cockroaches, on the other hand, are small-bodied, light brown or tan, with telltale
stripes. They prefer warm, humid places that also provide a source of food — places like kitchens.

It turned out that rooting out a German roach infestation was a lot of work. It involved several rounds of insecticide as well as baited traps meant to entice the roaches to eat poisoned food, then return to the nest and share it with their fellows. The girl did not want poison in her kitchen. She did not want to clear off every shelf, wipe it down, and bait it. She did not want to vacuum every joint seam in the room; joint seams were something she hadn't noticed before but that suddenly seemed to be everywhere, a coalescence spiraling into infinity like a Fibonacci sequence. All the storage space that had once delighted her now housed the enemy. All the crevices that once seemed almost too generous were now unknown.

The girl knew what to do in this situation because it is what you're supposed to do
when something goes wrong: call the landlord. The landlord would send over the
superintendent, an overly friendly alcoholic in his late 50s. The superintendent, toting
his bottle of chemicals, would show up unannounced, probably during a work call. He might mention that he would hate to walk in on her naked. He might ask whether she had a boyfriend yet. He'd done both of these things before, and the girl hadn't really registered them until he'd left. She wished she'd come up with a sharp retort — even screamed at the man to get out of her house. Instead, she had done nothing as he walked down her narrow hallway, down the stairs, and back out into the world. The memory of her own impotence made her feel a bit sick.

The next morning before work, the girl unlocked her phone and scrolled through her
contacts, finger hovering above her landlord's number. She walked into the kitchen,
which looked pristine. She tried to resurface the panic of last night and couldn't; nearly
eight hours unconscious is enough to dull the edge of most mundane horrors. 
Instead, she put down her phone and picked up the kettle.

Days passed. One morning, she opened the kitchen cabinet to find a crunchy, striated,
yellowish sac about the size of a dime lying next to a stack of bowls. It was hollowed out,
empty. But she thought she knew what had been in there.

She started seeing the roaches more often. In the evening, she'd come into the kitchen
and catch one scurrying out of the dish-drying rack. Once, in broad daylight, a full-grown insect wriggled out of the electrical outlet next to her toaster. She smashed the bugs with anything on hand: a piece of mail, a book, the blue silicone spatula she happened to be holding. After a while, she cut out the middleman and started killing them with the naked palms of her hands. They were so small, their exoskeletons so fine, that they barely made a crunch.

She did try some things on her own. She bought clear plastic protectors designed to
baby-proof plugs. Cinnamon powder, according to the internet, was a roach deterrent; she sprinkled it in corners. She wasn't sure whether she actually expected any of this to help. It was more that it felt necessary to seem to be doing something. The roaches still
disgusted her, but she'd stopped panicking when they showed up. Their absence was a
nice surprise, but their presence was expected, like passing an unpleasant neighbor on
the way to work.

One night, the girl stayed out much later than usual. Normally she didn't do drinks on a
weekday, but her coworker had gotten laid off, and she'd gone to an East Village bar in
reluctant solidarity. By the time she got home it was edging 2 a.m., and she was
starving. She stumbled into the kitchen, felt its cool tiles beneath her sock feet, and
turned on the overhead light. She saw what she'd been expecting: a flurry of movement,
flashes of pale brown against the creamy floor.

"Hi, boys," she said.

**

It was March, and the girl felt as though she was coming alive again. The winter had
been brutal with a polar vortex hanging over much of the state for months, and she'd only recently started to re-perceive herself as a body covered in skin rather than thin thermal base layers. Her apartment had stayed warm throughout, ancient radiators
screaming. They had kept her alive — kept her friends alive, too.

A colleague was on his way over for an after-work drink. They had one of those relationships that skated on the edge of flirtation. She could recall one or two things she'd said to him that might have crossed a line. But she was so alone, and he didn't seem to mind, which was a thin way of saying she hadn't yet been reported to HR. She had proposed meeting up to plan for their next presentation. He'd agreed, and he hadn't even flinched when she'd suggested her place.

The buzzer rang, and the girl adjusted the bottle of red she'd placed on the kitchen
island. She performed the familiar sprint and skid down the hall, arriving at the door
with enough time to catch her coworker's face in the videocom. She buzzed him in and heard him climbing the steps.

She unlatched the door and went back to the kitchen to set out wine glasses. He
knocked, and she yelled down the hall — a cool girl, a carefree girl — for him to come in.
He took his shoes off by the door.

She heard him walking down the hall to the kitchen, and then he was there, in the warm,
bright space with her, breathing a little heavily from the stairs. He smelled sweet like
sun-scorched grass.

The girl watched him look around then watched his face twist into what might have
been revulsion. She was confused as to why this might be. Had she forgotten to reapply
deodorant? Did he hate red wine?

But he wasn't looking at the bottle; his eyes were fixed on the floor.

"Umm," he said. "What the fuck? Anna... what the fuck?"

The girl patiently brushed a roach off her calf. Looking around, she could see more on
the island, more crawling up the walls, more peeking out from under the stove. Dozens and dozens, a seething carpet of brown specks. She had forgotten to tell him about her friends, but she really hadn't thought he would mind. The boy edged back in the direction of the door, and the girl stepped toward him.

"It's fine," she said. "They belong here." She smiled.`,

    title: "In Defense of Giving Up on a New City",
    author: "Julian Shendelman",
    content: `This Boy is an obvious symptom of your Craigslist problem. A patchwork of blue and purple links swim across the glaring white screen, easily the 10th time that week. And then, there it is: Casual Encounters > T4T > “Big spoon ISO little spoon, NSA” 

You find him in Dolores Park wearing the exact same outfit as you (black skinny jeans and narrow suspenders, as was the style at the time) sitting on a playground swing and letting the dirty toes of his Chucks trace patterns in the sun-warmed sand. The coincidences stack up: both of you left-handed, both Libras, both having lived in the same nothing suburb as adolescents without ever crossing paths, both voracious readers of Foucault and Butler. Plus, the whole transsexual thing. His coral bedroom wasn’t his at all, a sublet filled with concerts on VHS, second-wave feminist theory, a coterie of dying houseplants. The cuddling was (unsurprisingly) short-lived, and hours later he came in a fit of giggles. You never stood a chance. 

At work the next morning, you sulk over a pile of freshly washed white towels, a stack of pornography for the bathhouse’s video system, a series of locker keys on red tags dangling from tiny hooks. It’s been just over a week since your co-worker blew off his entire hand with fireworks, five days since the last Craigslist find returned your calls, three days since Oakland last erupted with tear gas, and 18 hours since you stumbled into the greatest one-night stand in the history of Craigslist. 

All of it, ephemera. And yet, he calls you after work. So much for casual encounters. 

On Friday night, your friend hosts a birthday party at a dim and sensual bar in the Tenderloin. You invite This Boy. Over a squat glass of brown alcohol, he confesses that he’s leaving in a few days: back to New York, back to his real boyfriend. The summer program he’d attended is over, and his sublet isn’t far behind. When he briefly disappears into the restroom, your friend says, “Well, at least you’ll never have to find out what’s wrong with him.” Still, when This Boy returns to his barstool, you agree to make the most of the time you have left. 

Saturday you’ll dance together while he rolls on molly, and Sunday he’ll come to stay at your apartment in Oakland. You’ll exchange gifts, swapping your presumptuous mix CD for his carefully wrapped Anne Carson novel, every few pages laced with pressed flowers. He offers you an improper courtship, which you carefully define together like the queer theorists you two claim to be. Appealingly inconvenient. Graceless. 

“We don’t have time for grace,” you say. A strange way to say “I do.” 

On the final morning, you ride into San Francisco together as he reads to you from the slim book in a hushed, warm tone. The train crescendos as the tunnel approaches, signaling your impending divergence, making it harder to hear. He closes the book, asks if he can hold your hand. His dread is physically palpable, pulsing through his palm. Fuck “no strings attached,” you want him to loop your strings around his fingers like a marionette and tug. You want to endlessly grip the fingers that had slept inside you until they mash into your own flesh. Long before you had a word for gender, you called yourself “weird.” You’ve been strange for so long, and now, you find indescribable comfort in his similarities. You have started finishing his sentences. It’s been less than a week. 

Your parting is crudely technological, a timing of trains. There’s a slow, desperate kiss, and when the doors part at Embarcadero, you exit, leaving him to jet toward his sublet, to his East-bound plane, and to his boyfriend’s Brooklyn apartment. He flashes two fingers through the scratched plexiglass: a peace sign. 

The novel This Boy gave you is so short you have to ration the pages to make it last. Carson says the Yamana had a word for “bite” that meant “to come surprisingly on a hard substance when eating something soft.” You remember standing outside of a childhood friend’s house one summer eating cotton candy. Jittery with sugar, you bit down hard, deep into your own finger. The iron in your mouth, sudden and surprisingly sweet, blood mixed with liquifying pink sugar. You recall the primal fear of seeing behind your skin, the misdirected anger at your rich friend’s mother, who had no Band-Aids in the pantry. You recall the shame of knowing that there was no one at fault but you. Memory is just this kind of bite, you decide. The sinking of a jaw, the inevitable knot at the center. 

#

Six months later, you’re walking up 18th street, past the alley where you’d attended a post-Dyke-March block party hosted by a glittery little leather cub a couple years back, the same summer you’d started hormones, the same summer you’d started seeing men with new eyes. You glide past the painted womb of the Women’s Building, the pseudo-European sidewalk café, the combination espresso bar/video store, the long line snaking out from the artisanal ice cream shop.

Honey lavender, roasted banana, salted caramel, earl grey. Manhood glimmers on the horizon like a forbidden and unavoidable oasis. 

The second he leaves his boyfriend, you decide you are done with this place, the first home you’ve made beyond your nothing suburb. You kiss your best friend goodbye, and pack your life into the back of your dead grandmother’s Toyota Corolla. 

You drive to a former Girl Scout camp in upstate New York, where you’ll both work for the summer. He is finally yours, and yours alone. 

What you find upstate bears little resemblance to the lucid dream of that initial courtship. His teeth are rotting out of his skull, and he refuses to seek treatment. He barely eats. He’s always angry. 

You are not to speak to him until he’s finished his morning routine: At sunrise, he unzips his sleeping bag, pisses off the front step, then returns to unfurl his yoga mat in the narrow space between your double cot and the door. After a half hour or so of stretching, he places a small spoonful of coconut oil in his mouth and lets it melt, swishing it around to mix with his saliva until his mouth brims with fluid. He opens the door again, spitting the oily mixture onto the piss stained dirt. He flosses with a strand of woven silk, then brushes his teeth with baking soda. 

The only thing that relieves the pain is a late night run through the unpaved roads surrounding the camp. Like you, he’s a city boy, afraid of bears, snakes, and falling branches, and he begrudgingly agrees to let you supervise. You drive slowly behind him as he tries to outrun the ache, the Corolla crackling over jagged pebbles. Radio off, high beams on. His silhouette fills the windshield, heels kicking up plumes of dirt, elbows pumping at his side, knit cap bouncing softly at the base of his neck, brushing over the faded Libra tattoo. The road rises and sinks, illuminating in turn his ankles and a streak of thick forest beyond. All summer, the world passes by in headlights, encircling his every move. 

When camp ends, you follow him to his latest home, a queer co-op a few miles from the White House. His bedroom, a walled corner of a windowless basement. He goes on a retreat for Black and Brown trans men, and hooks up with That Boy, a gap-toothed, freckled activist with eyes like iridescent puddles. That Boy is a city you begin to know secondhand. He works in the same industry as This Boy. He cries easily. He fucks well. These are not mutually exclusive. This Boy visits That Boy in Philly, leaving you alone in the co-op’s basement. You emerge daily to eat a bowl of communal beans and watch the first season of Glee with This Boy’s bisexual roommate, crying together because it’s 2011 and Glee still means something. You wait for the flame of This Boy’s new improper courtship to extinguish. 

But the flame only grows brighter. You decide the only way you can stop feeling threatened is to meet him, to find out what’s wrong with him. 

You and This Boy drive up to Philly in a hurricane. He waits in your dead grandmother’s car, the tires half-submerged in flood water; you have to face this alone. You dip into the Eritrean restaurant, ankles soaked, and find the threat seated alone at a high table. He’s beautiful and pleasant. He makes you laugh. He even smells good. It is the absolute worst case scenario. You share a vegetarian platter, ripping at the same piece of tender, sour bread. 

By the time This Boy moves to Philly, you’ve already made a home for yourself in a co-op just three blocks from That Boy’s studio apartment, in a city with dozens of other neighborhoods to choose from. Your bedroom, if you can call it that, has a sheer curtain instead of a fourth wall, but the rent is $300, utilities included. You get an internship at That Boy’s non-profit. If you moved any closer, you’d be inside of him. You’d finally be convenient. Everyone knows what happens next. 

# 

The car is jammed to the roof when you park outside That Boy’s building. “Ready?” you ask. 
“Something like it,” This Boy sighs, fidgeting with the brim of his fitted cap. The boxes start escaping one by one, covering the sidewalk in traces of every bedroom he’s ever had. You are a mile away from yourself, admiring your remarkable tolerance through binoculars. You have expanded more than you ever thought possible, able to hold nearly two years of compromise. How else could you be here, seven months later, in a city that isn’t yours? How else could you be here, seven months later, helping them move in together? 

You heard the news from That Boy on your shared commute to work. Heartbreak, then relief. Someone else can settle down in Philadelphia, someone else can buy curtains at IKEA, someone else can fight in the kitchen, or barricade themself in the bathroom to cry. It doesn’t have to be you. 

The elevator fills, leaving a perfect void for you to fill as This Boy runs up the stairs to meet you. That Boy is still at work, which saves you the trouble of their bickering. You try to stay present, but you’re neither here nor there nor then nor now. The linear progression of “getting over it” and “moving on” simply doesn’t apply. Time, as messy as wanting, as trying, as almost. Time, a sea of qualifiers. Boxes disappear into a spare closet in That Boy’s studio. Their studio. Cardboard slips through your palms as you vacillate between feeling helpful and combustible, your seams held together by a miraculous glue of maturity, drive, or maybe god. The smoothness of it all almost makes you understand This Boy’s ability to hold you and That Boy in separate hands at the same time. Almost. You dream of a mouth to possess. 

It’s spring and you’ve started daydreaming about your former home. You can almost see the dark, winding drive through the skyless Oakland hills, higher and higher until a sharp turn into the observatory results in your eyeball pressed against the padded mouth of a barn-sized telescope. You are almost back there with This Boy, dancing in the observatory’s empty parking lot, windows rolled low, blaring a psychedelic ballad that sets your sneakers on fire. A single street lamp paints his skin sunset orange, his dark jeans cling to his scarred hipbone, a white gash where an old studded belt had dug its way in. He holds his arms out to you, purple eyes inked into the creases of his elbows. You can’t remember if This Boy was wearing his glasses or the fitted cap with the rolled brim or if he’d shaved or left a springy patch to sprawl beneath his chin or if he had metal gauges in his earlobes or if he’d purchased the glass portals yet. All you know is that two pairs of feet spun in circles, slapping the pavement, trying and failing to shake loose from gravity. 

You’ve given yourself three more months of Philly until packing everything you own back into your car and driving west, past the Eritrean restaurant where the ending began, past the This and That Boys’ apartment and their newfound monogamy, past the place where your mental map of the city turns to void. Someone else will assume your internship while a ghostly self drives west, a disembodied body rolling home. The life that should have been will keep evolving without you. A body awaits you in California; there is empty skin there. 

When your mind clears, you take the trolley east. You introduce yourself to Skyler in the smoking corridor outside a Center City gay bar. He’s fishnet and purple lipstick on stark white skin, a wild, sweaty nest of deep brown hair and sideburns. At midnight he turns 23 and by 1:00 you’re tangled up in his little mouth, running your fingers over the mesh holes of his shirt, pale pink nipples sprouting like grass through a chain link fence. 

You ask if he knows what you are, and he does, which is disappointing. He also knows the lyrics to every pop song. Without thinking, you drag your thumb through his melting eyeliner, leaving behind a cleaner brushstroke of black. He looks as though some soft thing inside of him has opened. 

“I’ve always needed someone to do that for me,” he whispers in your ear. “Where have you been?” 

This doesn’t, can’t fill the vacancy. But you let him sublet the wound. 

Later that week, Skyler follows you home from a house party. His floral Laura Ashley dress catches you off guard and something sours guiltily within you. His posture is a city you’ve been avoiding. Feminine is not the issue, but womanly still feels like a heel rubbed raw. After a failed attempt to fit your Craigslist bike into his backseat, he drives slowly behind you up Baltimore Ave as you pedal back to the co-op, enveloped in headlights. 

Shortly after midnight, Skyler unbuttons his dress to crawl into your bed. The mattress was never really empty — This Boy had been coming over weekly to eat and smoke, each of you dragging out the conversation until he was too tired to leave. In the middle of the night, you’d toss an arm over his waist and he’d scoot back against your pelvis, sighing. Nobody asks what That Boy thinks. All the better. 

Skyler hovers between your thighs and asks if you trust him. Buzzy and warm, you do, you really do.  

When This Boy comes by a few days later, you tell him about everything except the dress. You say, “I’m going to see him again next week.” This Boy smiles, and there’s some kind of twitch or flicker to it, a lightbulb on the verge of burning out. He’s finally learned to make the face you’ve worn for months. A small, ugly part of you swarms with delight.  

It’s over in a few weeks. Skyler sends you a photo of him — them — in a training bra and you’re back in middle school. Their jaw dips coyly, shoulders squeezed together to emulate cleavage. You desperately want to like this, but it’s just not happening.  

This Boy is working late in your bed, propped up on his elbows responding to emails. You drape over the small of his back, cheek pressed against the skin as you slip toward sleep. Just before the dream hits, you call out to him. He says he loves you, too. 

You run into That Boy a lot at your internship. He always greets you by name. He always smiles that gap-toothed smile. If there’s any hostility, it’s perfectly hidden. One day, you two share an elevator with a short, blonde, and precisely groomed young man for seven whole stories. When you and That Boy exit on the same floor, you exhale in tandem, then burst out laughing because of course you have the exact same taste.

During a fire drill, you and That Boy stand on the corner and spot the elevator man across the intersection, shifting his little feet and checking his watch. That Boy calls him “fine,” drawing out the vowel like he’s unraveling a sweater, and now you want him even more. 

After work, you meet up with friends at the Eritrean restaurant slash dive bar. Strands of perennial Christmas lights dangle between the brown cigarette machine and the corner mounted TV with its blaring soccer game. The walls are littered with beer ads and karaoke fliers, photos of the restaurant’s late owner. After plunking down a couple bucks for a whiskey ginger, you turn to find the elevator man by the little neon jukebox, engrossed in conversation with a woman in business casual. His arrival, a cosmic signal that demands your compliance. After an hour or so, you and your well drink work up the courage to approach him. You say something, but it all happens so quickly there’s no telling what. Either way, you thrust a napkin with your number into his hand and flee. 

Two days later, you meet the elevator man in a Rittenhouse gastropub for drinks you can’t afford. He’s older than you expected: a 36-year-old rock-climbing Jewish lawyer with a designer dog. Your mother would die. You make a pact with yourself: if he picks up the tab, you’ll put out. You get up to use the restroom and when you return, the bill is already paid. 

His apartment is the nicest you’ve seen in this city. He kisses like a little bird, barely opening his lips. You’re unsure of how to handle his genital piercings and nobody comes. It’s surprisingly comfortable in its mediocrity, as though you’d skipped ahead to the part of the relationship when the most gratifying aspect of your arrangement is a warm body in a well-furnished home. It’s not bad. But it’s also not good. 

#


On Memorial Day, you and This Boy sit on the trunk of your car, soaking up the heat from its chipped black paint job. A child at a lemonade stand serves nonexistent customers. A woman struggles to remove the stiff fabric cover from a barbeque. This Boy looks straight ahead as he talks. When you tire of watching his cheeks move, you rest your head on his shoulder. 

“Oh, you,” he sighs. American flags sag from their poles in the humid air. He talks in circles about your impending departure. “If things had gone differently,” he says, “we’d be six months in by now.” Six months in to what, he doesn’t say. 

# 

Time is wet and elusive, but manages to hold still long enough for an afternoon traffic jam on the way back from King of Prussia. You talk about how the mall here differs from that of your shared nothing suburb, a sprawling outdoor complex unfettered by snow. The conversation veers off course. He admits that the studio apartment is killing him — the rough gray carpet, the maladjusted cat, the attempt at monogamy, and That Boy, perpetually on the verge of emotional collapse. Smug satisfaction fills you, followed by a wave of hot frustration. The indignity, the audacity of his unhappiness. The shadow of his moving boxes, still heavy in your hands. 

Back at the studio apartment, you find That Boy curled up like a cooked shrimp in their bed. He startles from his nightmare, panics. This Boy comforts him with a familiar, placating tone, a voice you once believed. You sit on the window ledge, staring as hard as you can at the blues and greens of the stained glass across the street. When That Boy calms, the three of you take a couple six-packs to the roof and wait for the light to die. 

The kingdom is flanked by endless churches, Victorian turrets, the swooping gray threads of a distant bridge. This Boy graciously fills the silence with the playlist on his phone and a smattering of small talk. The sky catches fire and That Boy, still drowsy with dissociation, traces helicopters and bats overhead with a pointed finger. Whenever a particularly tender song comes on, you catch This Boy’s sharp eyes. That Boy squirms, so you start pacing the roof’s perimeter. With each step, you imagine your leg vanishing beneath you and reappearing through someone’s ceiling. You tightrope from the northwest corner, to the southwest, the southeast, the northeast, and That Boy, that bitter boy, calls your name, softly, as though he doesn’t want it in his mouth, and hugs you goodnight. This Boy must’ve said something. The sky purples, then perforates with pinpricks of distant light. 

Summer sirens cry in the distance. You empty bottles until there is nothing to say but the unsaid. He calls you a coward for running back to California, as though you hadn’t run to him in the first place. The sorest song emerges from his pocket and it hits you all at once — the playground where you met, the petals pressed between pages, the way his back looked in your headlights, the smell of his Egyptian Musk. Finally, after months of tolerance and patience and composure, you lose it. “You have no idea,” you wail. “You have no fucking idea.” 

When he wraps his arms around you, you promise to wait for him in California. “Don’t wait,” he says. “Don’t settle.” A contradiction in terms, you think. 

“One last time?” he asks. Your mouths abandon each other so quickly they may as well have never met. His lips, dull as a wet match. 

Back in your own bedroom, you’ll pry open the shoebox and read every postcard, rubbing the wood pendant he made you at camp between your thumb and forefinger until it gleams with your oil. And This Boy will stay up on the roof until the bottles are empty, then shatter every last one, brown glass glittering across the building’s fragile scalp. 

# 

On the first leg of the trip, you pass through three tunnels with names so long you’re in the middle of a mountain before you can finish a word: Kittatin— Tuscaror— Alleghen— You pass the time by listening to lesbian folk music you’ve forgotten about, or simply screaming with the windows down. You cry out at the innumerable trees lining the highway, the fundamentalist Christian billboards, the impossible mileage accumulating on the odometer before you.  
Chicago. Minneapolis. Bismarck. Bozeman. Spokane. Seattle. A week later you’re barreling out of Portland when a swarm of birds jets over the freeway, freckling the sky with black, fluttering kites. 

You recall sitting in a parking lot in the open back of your mother’s minivan as a murmuration performed daring acrobatics in the gray autumn sky. It circled the palm trees, veering left and right and straight down and then, impossibly late, yanked straight back up like military jets. You haven’t seen her in over a year. 

In a small town 80 miles north of Eureka, there’s a long stretch of boarded up storefronts, dead cars, and tall grass. Fog dangles heavily over the road, suspended by some hidden crane. Delirious from hours of driving, you follow a beach access sign off the highway and stumble down to the water’s frigid edge. The sky, the sand, and the sea — all the same shade of nothing. Sandals kicked off, an icy little wave sucks at your toes. You swallow the clean, salty mist and feel one step away from falling off the planet entirely. 

The rest of the day’s drive is spent where forest meets ocean. Beyond the passenger window, a massive, staggeringly white bank of atmosphere pours through trees and leaks onto the road. The cars ahead drown in the haze, vanishing one by one by one. Clusters of stoic elk greet you when the road splits off from the coast and then, Eureka. 

After a long moment in your silent car, your knuckles rap on the door of a pink Victorian co-op. A sturdy looking queer in nothing but overalls ushers you inside and up a creaky staircase. “That’s where you’ll be sleeping,” they say, gesturing to a windowless nook on the way to your Craigslist host’s bedroom. “Turnip!” Overalls hollers before swinging open the door at the end of the hall. 

Turnip is soft and narrow and invites you to sit beside him on the purple sofa. His room has high ceilings and its own bathroom, a luxury you thought impossible on this coast. You’ve been staying with so many strangers this week that you’ve developed a list of safe conversation starters. Instead of “How can you afford this place?” you ask, “Where are you from?” and Turnip’s little heart-shaped mouth says, “Here.” The safe question suddenly feels stupid and empty. The sun melts outside the peeling window frame, pooling like a lava lamp. 

“You must be tired,” Turnip says, and you take the hint, standing to stretch your crunchy back. “Come get me in the morning, I’ll make you breakfast.” You debate whether or not it’s appropriate to hug him, but before you can decide, he bids you goodnight and leaps into his unmade bed. Back in the guest nook, only a thin gash of light seeps under the door. When the last roommate goes to bed, someone flicks a switch in the hallway and you’re wrapped in a lush feather comforter of darkness. 

It’s still pitch black when your alarm sounds, and for a moment you think you’re still in This Boy’s basement bedroom in D.C. You could never tell the time or date without digging around in the sheets for a phone. 10:00am didn’t feel much different than 3:00pm or even 5:00. And when he was gone visiting That Boy, it didn’t matter. 

You creak down the bright hallway to Turnip’s room. He doesn’t answer when you knock, so you open the door and call his name. He jolts awake, stumbling past you to look for a robe, and you studiously avoid eye contact with his morning wood. The sky has returned to its murky status quo. You are not thinking about his erection. 

“I’ll make you breakfast” turns out to mean “I’ll pour you a bowl of cereal.” After cornflakes and an awkward hug, the first physical contact you’ve had in days, you swing your bag over your shoulder, coax your car into starting, and pull away from the robed queer waving on the front step. 

At Eureka’s edge, you see the paper mill Turnip had mentioned while telling you about his hometown. The massive structure is lined on both sides with inconceivably high stacks of logs and boards. At the mill’s center, rusted towers pump out thick, white steam that feeds into the enduring clouds: a sky machine. 

140 miles from Oakland. The last three hours evaporate and your gut seizes with hunger. It’s time to slow down or eat or at least document the journey. But 140 is nothing compared to the 3,700 miles eclipsed this week, or the 8,200 miles added to the six-figure odometer in the last year alone. You’ve been nowhere or somewhere for so long your mouth waters at the idea of being “here,” of biting down deep enough to find the hard center of it all.`,

    author: "Sarah Chin",
    content: `1. 
The sublet ad doesn't tell the whole truth. Well, everything in it is technically accurate—one-bedroom apartment, ten-minute walk to the subway, fifteen to the nearest grocery store. But Quinn still feels dishonest.
She had lived here for years, but this was the first time alone. She didn't want to leave, but she knew that she needed to move somewhere, anywhere else. 
She rewrote the ad.
Looking for a short-term subletter. One-bedroom apartment. Ten-minute walk to the subway, fifteen to the nearest grocery store. Maybe haunted.

2. 
Of course, the apartment resisted them when they first moved in.
They were barely over their post-graduation hangovers, still stupid enough to think they understood everything about the world. No wonder the place, a pre-war walkup, disliked them. The floorboards creaked loudly under their feet, the doors stuck in the humidity, the air smelled like someone else's memories.
But they insisted. They painted the walls mustard yellow, hung framed photos, adopted a cat named Mittens and let her weave fur into the furniture.
The apartment, after a time, softened. The walls absorbed arguments, apologies, their raucous laughter, becoming weighted and yielding. The shower learned to sigh instead of scream. The windows exhaled with delight when they opened them.
One night, as they drifted toward sleep, all of them exhaled together in perfect time—the humans, the cat, the apartment. This is home.

3.
One night, Quinn dreams the apartment is leaving.
She watches from the street as it unsticks from the ground, bricks dissolving into air like fog. The window where she used to sit with him blinks out. The kitchen, the bathroom, the bedroom—gone.
She doesn't wake up startled. She wakes up relieved. 
In the morning, she looks around. The apartment is still here. Nothing looks different. Everything seems the same.

4.
The apartment door sticks every time she comes home, just enough that she has to throw her shoulder into it. It's always been that way. He used to joke that it was the place testing them, making sure they were worthy.

Now, alone, Quinn imagines it's something else. A hesitation. A pause. A final warning.

One evening, after a long day, she shoves the door open harder than usual. It slams into the wall, leaving a dent. She stares at it for a long time.

The next morning, she tapes a takeout menu from a place called "Great Wall #1" over the mark. She's never been and decides that maybe she would like to go.

5.
The first time Quinn brings a different guy home to the apartment, it feels like a betrayal.
She cracks open a bottle of red, and they drink it straight from the bottle on the couch in hearty swigs. They both know what is going to happen, but they pretend they don't.. The absurdity of the situation makes Quinn laugh—really laugh— and the sound startles her. 
Later, they have brief, unremarkable sex. It ends when Quinn starts crying while she's on top, dribbling salt water onto his chest. Quinn assures him that it's not him, it's her. He sheepishly excuses himself from the room, and Quinn never sees him again.
The next morning, Quinn makes coffee, humming to herself. The apartment doesn't protest.

6. 
"The walls are thin," Quinn warned the bored-looking, slightly goth college student interested in subletting for the summer. It wasn't the type of thing you said when trying to get someone to rent your place, but she just wanted to be honest. The student nodded with detachment, black-lined eyes swivelling around the room.
Quinn didn't mind the thin walls. She liked the murmuring proof of other people's lives: the neighbor who sang off-key in the shower, the couple who argued and made up in the span of an hour, the tap-tap-tap of a child learning to walk upstairs.
One night, after crying into her pillow, she heard it—a soft knock on the wall beside her bed. Just once.
She knocked back.
In the morning, she didn't check the listing. By noon, she deleted it. The apartment exhales.

7. 
Quinn maps the apartment with her steps, each room a borderless country: some conquered, some still resisting. The kitchen is still and has always been hers: sunlit, familiar, the scent of spilled cinnamon lingering in the cabinets. The bedroom, though, belongs to absence now. The indentation on the left side of the bed is untouched, cold as a lunar crater.
At night, she sleeps diagonally, trying to claim more land.
One morning, she moves the bed to the opposite wall. The space shifts. The grief stretches thin, so thin that light seeps in. A new country is born.

8. 
She finds it on a Tuesday, as she's cleaning out her closet—a door she's certain wasn't there before.
She touches the handle, hesitates. Behind it could be anything: an extra room, a forgotten crawl space, an entirely different life.
For three days, she walks into the closet, lets her fingertips graze the handle, then walks out. She tells herself she doesn't need to open it. What good would more space do?
On the fourth day, she turns the knob.
The door opens into the city, high above the streets. Warm air rushes up. Quinn breathes in. It smells like spring—fresh green and asphalt. 
She steps through.`,

    title: "Fire Escape",
    author: "Jess Mendes",
    content: `She was sitting in her parked car, looking at her old fire escape, trying to make out something meaningful. Maybe a specter fluttering like tattered fabric from the railing. Or a figure in the window. Something to solidify that the slick blackness behind the glass was a space that could still be occupied. She didn't know what she was supposed to be looking for.

For years, she'd been trying to find the center of herself. The start or the end. Wherever the thread could be picked until it unraveled. She tried first to find it on her body. Poking around the surface to find some singularity. The belly button? The left hand? That one freckle? No. Then, she figured it could be somewhere inside. Maybe down her throat. She waited patiently at first for something to exit. An utterance to emerge and spill over the horizon of her bottom lip, but nothing ever escaped. And reaching down there led to a hard, fleshy stop towards the back of her mouth. What she came to realize was this: the center of herself was not within her. She didn't know if it even existed in the first place. But something in the searching led her to waking up in the cool blue of an almost-dawn, getting in her car, and driving back to her childhood apartment. It was a brick building. The outside was painted a champagne yellow. She watched the place. The windows were dark.

That apartment always smelled like cat piss. The place was everything a person would never want to be. Dirty, ugly, and uncouth. Perpetually undusted. Her room was so full of particles it almost felt like there was another presence there alongside her. The kitchen never had food. She didn't like anything about the place. But once—while he still lived there—her dad came home shitfaced with a gerbil in his front pocket. With a grin he revealed the creature cupped delicately in his big hands. It was so small and peachlike, fluttering with breath. "He needs a home," her dad told her. They poked holes in the biggest Tupperware they had. She fed him shredded cabbage from a coleslaw kit. Gave him small capfuls of water. She held his small home up to eye-level and watched him bathe himself, tucking his small head into his hands. The gerbil's room reminded her a lot of her own. Small and rectangular. One night, her dad walked into her room and told her he had to go away for a bit. Around the same time, their gerbil escaped. Nobody seemed to notice but her.

She spotted her dad's parked car a ways away from the apartment on her walk home from school one day. How many weeks had it been since he'd left? Time battered against her. Everything made less and less sense. When he finally came back, he sat at the edge of her bed and curled into himself. He smelled different. She couldn't have known that would be the last time she would see him. And people can't do things about what they don't know. Except what if she could feel that there was something to know, the way a body can feel a coming storm.

She told him she had found the gerbil shriveled against the radiator.

It wasn't there. The center of herself couldn't possibly exist in a place so depressing. She was getting there, though, she had to be. If she wasn't, then what was the point of idling there, looking up at a now-stranger's window? She just had to get closer, and she knew how to get up there. She could do it with her eyes closed. Jump against the outcrop of larger brick and rest her feet along the ridge. Use her upper body to stretch outwards and grab the ladder's bottom rung. Go up brick by brick. Rung by rung. So, that's what she did. Climbed up. She was almost to it, whatever it was, but the morning was coming faster than she would've hoped.

She remembered the first time she had snuck out of her old bedroom window. The screen fell away and she looked up towards the sky. Out there, the distant highway sounded like an ocean. She saw the faintest star or two against the light-pollution.

Now she looked in through the dark window. There it was. Her old room. It had curtains now; they were drawn open. The bed wasn't in the same place. She could see a figure sleeping there. She squinted. It was a grown-up woman in there, tangled in her top sheet in such a way that it was clear the night had been restless. The room was smaller than she remembered. She looked at the walls, they were no longer a childish pistachio but instead a deep sage, the color of closer. She leaned further in. Her Ikea chandelier was gone. She wondered if the place held any of her there at all. Some of her skin particles must have settled into the floorboards. Something. There. A soft press in the drywall where her fist had landed angrily almost a decade ago.

The woman stirred slightly. Shit. She looked behind her to see a sky quickly turning toward morning. Time to go. It was always time to go. She headed back down. Feeling emptier yet better. She didn't understand why. Something so sad and weird, but once utterly her own, was no longer hers. How many universes would she have to step through to get back to that one? To fit back into a world she had outgrown.

When she was very young, so young she could barely remember it, she had this recurring dream. She'd find herself out on a roof looking out at a sea of night and would try to walk into it. She wanted—she needed—to go. Many times she almost got her footing, she swore she did, but she'd always slip and tumble back to wake up in her bed, terrified. Maybe that's where the fissure started. That was where she messed up. Where everyone does. We start our lives with this urge toward anywhere. The whole thing is so animal. We gnaw at our cage, stretch our limbs, hit a billion steps and think, huh. We go and we go and we go.`,

    content: `From my vantage point, slouched as I am in a camp chair near the rim of a crater in the Mare Serenitatis region of the moon, it doesn't matter where you walk your dog, the point is that smells are smelled. Or is it smelt? I happen to be more intrigued by alchemy than metallurgy, and I abstain from eating fish so that's that. Hang on, let me just

~Take your time~

Sorry, had to chip some ice from that crater floor for my drink. Anyway, as I was saying, I was standing at the kitchen sink last week, splashing cool water on my face, when I noticed a small bird building a nest beneath the eaves. It reminded me of my time spent as a bird years ago, and I lost myself in reminiscence. Birds, see, don't realize they live in the sky. They pull at woebegone worms and make their nests with varying degrees of expertise and chuckle as human offspring collect the shit-covered eggshells and spare no thought to set or setting. All of this happens in the sky, though they don't know it's the sky, but do they have to? Without the sky, where would they fly, but the fact is they do, so there must be sky, otherwise there would just be birds and not fly, they just don't trouble their minds with such frivolous uncertainties.

~Perhaps they're right not to. But weren't you talking about dogs?~

…

My dog admitted to me, in that sheepish way dogs have about them any time they do anything with intention, that she failed to smell a particular smell on the walk we'd just concluded. It was just gone, she told me. So? I didn't register the significance. 
Smells don't just vanish
she growled, 	
they move, they fade, or they usually stay put.
??? 
That's how I know where I am. 
Smells are how I know I'm home, or not home, if I'm safe, if you're safe, if there's a new cat. 
Smells can appear, but THEY CAN'T DISAPPEAR. IT'S WEIRD. SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.
What was it a smell of? 
…well…you… 
Needless to say I'm switching her food and walking her on a different street.

~Maybe she was onto something…?~

Clearly, but that me wasn't picking up what she was putting down, at least not in that sense. Now obviously I see I was the one being taken for a walk. 

~Tell me more~

A cloud, I teach my students, is made up of quadrillions of tiny water droplets suspended in the air. They take many shapes: cumulus, stratus, cirrus, the hybrids like stratocumulus and cirrostratus, and the subversives like lenticular, and my favorite, mammatus. Fog is a cloud, too, you know? Mix human folly with fog and you get smog. All of them live in the atmosphere. It's a nice place to call home, wouldn't you agree? Lots of space, water readily available, wind to take you where you like, and you can be anything you want to be when you grow up, like a wolf or a hare or a tornado. Sometimes people come to visit, and thankfully never stay long. Yes, the atmosphere is pretty happening, and we wouldn't have it without gravity, which we wouldn't have without Earth itself, but Earth itself depends on the atmosphere to be habitable, and without that there'd be no life and therefore no consciousness as we know it to remark on any of these things, but that begs consideration of where then would all the unconsciousness reside?

~You talk to youth of unconsciousness?~

Talked. That was not this body either. But no, of course not. I was getting there myself, but hadn't the confidence or authority. 

~Take me back further~

Millenia ago I was a vein of gold, Au, atomic number 79 baby, weighing in at 197 (rounded up of course). This was an incarnation marked by one of the greatest distillations of peace I have known. My early years in the far-flung cosmos a shade of a memory, I migrated through the solid Earth, slower than the passage of time itself, riding fluids up hydrothermal highways. I came to rest, finally, in perfect dark, perfect warmth, purely existing beyond measure or quality. An eternal vibe as such was not meant to be, as you well know. The world exploded around me and I was torn from my home and, it felt like, my very subconsciousness. I witnessed unspeakable things…

…

…sorry. 

…

Now, there is fleeting dark, meagre flesh-warmth, and foul, unnatural greed, as I pass my days wrapped around digits, dangling over sternums, a constant object. I used to know god through transcendence, now I knew god only by, like her, being the repeated subject of hideous conflict. 

~Why now the moon?~

My infatuation with the moon began as a child. One day I saw a waning gibbous and it was the sexiest thing I had ever seen, though I had yet to develop any concept of sex or lust. I would gaze at it from my window when I was meant to be sleeping full of feelings I didn't understand. Much of life was that way. Though I shared the same episodes and spaces - the house, the yard, the block, the car, and occasionally other structures - with my parents, this collective experience was tangible only. They saw the house as a pastiche of unfinished jobs and unrealized ambitions. To me the house was a capsule in space, a submersible in the ocean, an impenetrably safe (until it wasn't) second womb. I looked with wonder through junk drawers, I peeled paint with glee. Spilling anything on the floor was an exercise in exorcising art. The walls were an extension of my parents, and in a lot of ways, myself. I was vaguely aware that there was more out there, but until my lunar beguiling, I had no desire for or attachment to it. The moon was the first temptation. Alas, that position did not last long beyond that time…

~So you reside there now as a tribute to the child?~

No, I'm here now for the view. And the palpable void. 

~...void? When did you begin to see the void?~

Oh, the last one. I've found myself increasingly drawn to the more mystical perspectives on all of this. One thread that's bound me recently is the false dichotomy seemingly at the core of everything. There is no void without form, and there is no form without void. There are near limitless ways to tweak this, to contextualize this, to appropriate, and pervert this. The one I keep coming back to is that I (nevermind all the constructs inherent in this subject), this body, this corporeal form, is realized by, would not be without, the space surrounding it, the not-I, the non-form, the void. So I am the space around me…?
I would think about this all the time. At work. In bed. Driving. Walking. At home, there are toys everywhere underfoot. Literally milk spilled, splattered all over, the table and floor. The din of children keeps me in the moment (a mindful way of saying I can't get a damn thing done otherwise), and I'm peripherally aware of a day in the future when I will give anything to hear it again, even for a minute. Sunlight slants through high windows, dust drifts through the rays. I pause, contemplating the void.

~Would you say you were enlightened?~

No, I held too many attachments still. I clung to my suffering. I was beginning to see through a lot of it, but I couldn't look at my daughter, or my son, and imagine them gone and me being okay with it. That was my final big boss…

~And now?~

I'm drinking juniper-infused moon water in the glow of a smoldering planet. I'm attached to nothing.

~Was it all worth it?~

Yes.
…				yes.


It was necessary.`,

    content: `There's a Fran Lebowitz joke I love and it isn't exactly funny: "What do you call a bunch of people smoking and drinking in a bar? The history of art." Filed under "why can't I smoke in here?" in her rather cramped catalogue, the joke points, I think, to a larger vacancy in American life. One reflexively thinks of the sober artists, the disabled artists, the asthmatic artists — those not pictured around the smoky, dingy table with Lebowitz and Andy Warhol and Peter Hujar and so on in all the old photos. But this doesn't mean, to adopt Gertrude Stein's phrase, that there was no there there. Certainly this group had conversations and disagreements as they smoked their throats to gravel; certainly they shared ideas and supported one another, even if resentfully. More importantly, they had a boundary, and felt more comfortable taking a risk within a contained, controlled environment. Another way to say this, I suppose, is that they shared a context, which is what Stein's there amounts to. It's this same aura of context people identify, knowingly or not, when they talk about Ernest Hemingway's Paris or David Bowie's Berlin, or 2015's Mexico City. These are shared places among a limited coterie; and the limit is their allure.

I've had a few theres in my life. Maybe the most fateful was going to the same bar every Tuesday night in the mid-aughts. Tuesday's rotation was an open mic and a poetry slam held on alternating weeks. The show usually ended around eleven, and the night involved a lot of talking and patio smoking and hanging around afterward as everyone sobered up enough to drive, and then we usually went somewhere else. I was 21 and didn't drink and could do things like follow poets around an emptied-out city and go to bed at three in the morning and wake up for work at six. Showing up every week was how I began to build my life, seeing the same people until we all became familiar to each other. And of course it was a place to talk about poetry, even if slam wasn't exactly what I had in mind for myself. And while this is all very analog, I don't want to discount the digital theres I've been to, like Xenith — a zine and forum that nurtured my early writing and where I met inexplicably talented young writers across the world, some of whose poems I still think of to this day ("so far life is like the roll of film which melted to my dashboard"). This was all nearly twenty years ago but I'm still in touch with several of these writers, and we check in with each other now and then. The phrase is made for a website like this: You had to be there.`,

    content: `I had taken notes, jotted down loose ideas. But the sticky note is gone, and I'm left at my desk; the sounds of a lawnmower and the light shuffling of air moving through the beaded door curtain don't do much to disrupt the silence. Nonetheless, they are present, they mark time, according to their own arbitrary logic. Now I hear a car backing up, its incessant beeping. Now it stops. Nothing is ever the same.

I've spent one week in and out of bed. I move in a triangular pattern between the bed, the couch, and the bathroom. A. and H. have become my impromptu nurses, A. bringing me cups of tea and yogurt, H. carefully avoiding crawling across my lap when I signal to him by placing a stuffed narwhal over the bandage on my leg. Instead, he curls up beside me, head turned almost upside down inside of himself, buried under orange and white fur. A. bought the narwhal at the hospital. It has a pale, blueish coloring with gray spotty swaths that look like they've been painted on, beady black eyes, a big axe and a long white horn spiraling out from the center of its head. I haven't had a stuffed animal since my fifth birthday, when my mom gave me Sparkles, the white cat with a bell on her collar. H. is suspicious of the narwal, because they are about the same size, though he can tell it's not alive.

This morning when I woke up, my shoes had been stolen. In my long dream I had been walking through Berlin with S., a friend I don't talk to anymore; we took the U-Bahn but before entering placed our shoes to the side under a tent in a pile of many other shoes. It was assumed that this was necessary, that they would be waiting for us on the other end of the tunnel. When we emerged, however, we realized that we had been duped. There was no supernatural dream logic going on here. We had moved through space, and our shoes had not. We were outraged. I was on my way to the airport; no shoes just wouldn't do. We met a gentle boatman who gave us a ride back to the place where we had left our shoes. As I ruffled through the pile, it became apparent that my black Reeboks were nowhere to be found. "You can come back and check on them, sometimes people return them," said the young German man whose job it was to guard the shoe pile. "I live in America!" I said, in French, feeling boisterous. "You shouldn't share that information so cavalierly," the shoe guardian replied with a sneaky smile, also in French. I woke up feeling puzzled, searching for my words.

Before I became a writer of sentences (if that is one definition of who I am), I moved my body through space; I strung together movements like sentences, and they required my whole body to be written. They required breath. I was often out of breath, after jumping across the floor, and the inability to catch it felt good. Like I had accomplished something. Like I had gotten my body from one place to another.

I met S. at ballet camp when we were 12. She wore an electric yellow strappy sports bra, and I was impressed. We shared a room for a few weeks, listening to Klaus Nomi's Lightning Strikes and Frank Zappa's Valley Girl while bouncing off the walls. This was different than the music I listened to with my ballet friends back at home, where our hive mind tastes were dominated by the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys. S. distinguished herself from the trends of the early 2000s by listening to music from the '80s, and I happily went along for the ride. Cain, in A Horse at Night: On Writing, shares that she is uninterested in literature about toxic female relationships. Is this something I am interested in? I doubt it. In the writing I like, conflicts are like a current moving through a river, a powerful haunting below a smooth, liquid surface. The end of relationships, the place from which they can't go on, I also experience as a haunting. The other person was there, now they aren't, though of course they are, somewhere in the world. S. in Berlin. M. probably here in LA. I heard she's training to be an orthopedic surgeon. When the nurse and anesthesiologist wheeled my bed into the operating room, did I think about her, did I worry I might find her there, that I might have unknowingly granted her access into my body, after all these years?

I met M. the same year I met S. We had just transferred to the same middle school and though we had been going to the same dance studio for a while, I had only seen her around there, never spoken to her. Near the end of high school, I moved in with her for a while, fleeing a controlling mother. At night, her stepbrother would toast white bread for me and spread it with honey and butter, something I would never be allowed to eat at home.

We were fiercely competitive. In the dance studio, above all, but also at school, both socially and academically. She was white with blond, stringy hair, a bookish, teacher's pet type with perfect grades. My grades were good too; I put all my energy into school and dance to escape a home situation characterized by a distraught mother and absent father, both burdened by my older brother's bouts with mental illness and his ensuing series of hospitalizations. I was mostly left at home with my mom, subject to her alternating episodes of rage, control, and care, and I vigorously sought to attain my own forms of control beyond the broken family structure. But with my racially ambiguous features, I didn't fit easily into categorizations, desperately as I wanted to. I longed for legibility, which M. embodied effortlessly. People would always remind me: M. is so perfect. I loved her as much as I was jealous of her, wanted to be her, rejected her. We shaped each other, by mirroring and by contrast.

We ended up at the same university, but when I got there, she had a new group of friends, friends who liked to play beer pong and move in a pack. At first she invited me to join them for nights out at 1020, the shitty dive bar near campus in Morningside Heights, but when I got there she would ignore me. I felt like she was performing her happiness, but maybe it was real. Those nights felt like rehearsed demonstrations of how much her new friends fulfilled her, how little she needed me now. I thought of us spooning in her bed in high school, pretending to be a married couple, and then of how she had told me, when I first kissed a girl, that it was disgusting. M. was full of contradictions, and for a while it felt like my job to make her see them, to reveal to her the dead ends of her preconceptions.

My first year of college, I slept in many beds to avoid having to sleep in my own, next to my assigned roommate in the dorms, whose college-induced anxiety was embodied by late night doom-scrolling and tireless preparation for her pre-dawn weekly radio show. A California native, I would wake and miss the green glow of foliage out my window. On weekends I would toss my readings and laptop into my backpack and spend hours on the subway to cross Manhattan or traverse the East River into Brooklyn, crashing with new friends, acquaintances, and one-night stands. I would follow the predictable patterns of flirtation to end up in a new bed for the night, taking in this new person's wallpaper and roommates, certain to wake up either repulsed or vehemently attached. I felt more at home anywhere other than in my own shoebox of a room, where candles and wine were outlawed and the windows only opened a crack, to prevent us from jumping to our deaths on Broadway below. As far as I know, M. stayed uptown, even on the weekends; almost everyone stayed uptown, going to college parties and lining up at 1020 in the snow.

Soon I made up excuses to not go to 1020, and M. stopped texting me. She never asked me to meet up just the two of us. The only way I could be with her was to witness her with her pack, to be made an observer, strictly on the outside. When I dream of her now, it is as this version of herself. I cannot access her, and it is clear that the performance has become reality, that it always was, in some way; impossible to say if it was all a trick or if her happiness was perfectly genuine. The distinction matters little.

I realize now that M.'s pseudo-invitations to gatherings at 1020 were only a preamble to catch me off guard before sending me, with a resolute finality, to a permanent state of abandonment. I am terrified of being cast out of my most tender relationships, of remaining here, outside of narrative, with no weapons of my own beyond sending the perpetrator back to a vengeful banishment of my creation as a reflexive, but ultimately, redundant punishment for my unexplained exile. In other words, I am all-too-familiar with the jagged counters of banishment, a second home of sorts that has me dreaming of S., whom I haven't heard from in two years, and also of M., who sent me to that desolate place before them all, who trained me, so to speak, in the art of being cast out into silence. I am waiting to settle here, for a new order to show itself, or, for the old order to reveal itself as on the cusp of an imminent erasure. I am waiting for abandonment to become a kind of freedom.

Back at my desk, I hear the hum of the air conditioner. My hip aches, but it's bearable now. I place my hand on the bandage, I want to sense the stitches bringing skin back together in real time. I want to imagine my skin growing, healing, mending, slowly closing over its opening, restoring my bodily integrity, so nothing can come in or out.

Hip arthroscopy involves placing the leg in traction and making two small incisions to enter the hip joint. Into the first, a minuscule camera is placed, and a light. "Inside the body, it's all dark," one of the surgeon's many assistants had told me, during a routine visit. The image appears on a monitor, and it is from this image that the surgeon does her work. Into the second incision, small tools are inserted, the labrum is reattached in its correct alignment between the femoral head and the acetabulum by way of sutures, and any bony impingements that could re-tear the cartilage are shaved down. My understanding is imperfect, and the words I use here are ones I had to learn.

The first surgeon I met, the one who diagnosed the tear, told me to get up to speed—to "learn the vocabulary"—before meeting with the surgeon who would operate. "Ask your questions to Google," he said when I tried to put them to him. The first surgeon only performed major orthopedic surgery (not ones like mine), gruesome surgeries that involved putting a person entirely back together after a car accident, after they'd lost or damaged vital structural body parts to the point of near irreparability. His dismissive tone as he referred my case to a female colleague trained in relatively more "minor" surgeries seemed to imply that anything less was "women's work." Someone told me once that to be a surgeon you have to be a bit of a psychopath. Is it because putting someone back together is not that different than tearing someone apart? Not an opposite action, but just the flip side of the same coin.

I wonder what work you are doing now, in that university hospital, if it is women's work, or psychopathic labor. I think for you, being a woman also meant being a psychopath. I mean this in the kindest of ways. Embodying femininity involved an essential distancing, biting down hard, performing what you took to be the ideal, through and through. To get too close to feeling was dangerous for you. Sometimes, rarely, you took what you called "mental health days" (well before the quasi-destigmatization of such practices) where you'd miss a day of high school. You told me you were afraid that if you didn't maintain perfection, the whole thing would fall apart, irrevocably. That one mistake would inevitably betray the whole system. One mistake. Your wholeness could be undermined by so little.

Dance is a more obvious kind of performance. In ballet studios, on stages, young people in varying stages of development, many of them female-bodied, are encouraged to perform, to be more themselves, or to be someone else entirely. In most studios, on most stages, the latter impetus dominates. The teachers, choreographers don't care so much who you are so much as how closely you can resemble the ideal. The dream of becoming the principal dancer, who moves as if jointless, her body supple and yet infinitely precise, the lines made by her frame clean, strong, incorruptible. She appears to be weightless; indeed, she usually doesn't weigh very much. She stands on the tips of her toes, en pointe, defying gravity, but her toes are bleeding; they are blistering, swelling inside layers of satin, burlap, cardboard, paper, and lambswool. She trims her toenails obsessively. She performs the ideal that has been ascribed to her gender, a dream of immateriality. She barely exists at all. Ideals are dangerous, but we all knew this, and we all fought against the realities of our bodies to get closer to them nonetheless. It was M. who came the closest, and our Swedish ballet teacher, Ms. E., loved her for it, loved her inappropriately, almost as her own child, for she had no daughters, only gangly blond sons, who had quit ballet when they were old enough to realize they were the only boys in class.

My talent was not in all-around perfection. I had terrible turnout, and shallow pliés—Ms. E. suggested on multiple occasions that I have a special bone (the existence of which I have not been able to corroborate) surgically removed from my ankles, so that they would bend more—my talent lay in spinning. For this reason, Ms. E. created endless spinning-oriented roles for me in the holiday and summer shows; once I even played the made-up role of the "spinning top." It frustrated me to be pigeonholed as the spinner, but I also knew that this was where I excelled, the only realm of ballet technique where even M. could not compete. I remember once playing around in the studio with the other girls and doing seven pirouettes (meaning "spin" or "whirl") by accident—my record. M. ignored me for the better part of a week afterward.

In spinning, I found an intoxicating disorientation, a tension between staying in place while engaging in rapid-fire movement. My favorite spins were variations on the fouetté (literally meaning "whipped" in French), a tricky kind of repetitive turn whose mechanistic structure belies the swirling illusion it produces. To perform a fouetté you bend the standing leg while extending the other forward at a 45 to 90 degree angle from the floor, then abruptly rise onto the toes of the standing leg and whip the extended leg out 90 degrees to the side before bending it in and bringing the toe to touch the standing leg's knee. Building on the momentum of the whip, and drawing your arms in and out in a scooping gesture to center yourself, you repeat this sequence and the turns multiply. It's possible all my fouettés may have played a role in the labral tear—my left leg, the side of the tear, was always my standing leg for spinning—but it's impossible to say. The tear becomes visible in an MRI with contrast dye inserted into the hip joint, making it glow, but the origin is harder to pinpoint. Tears can emerge from a single incident or from wear and tear over time. They are common among dancers, who repetitively force their hips into extreme external rotation.

Arguably, the most important part of any pirouette is "spotting," or keeping your head level and gaze focused on the same spot, then quickly spinning your head around with your body before re-centering your gaze. It is this hyper focus that keeps you from becoming dizzy and losing your balance. If you are going to spin in circles, to see all four sides of the room shift around you, again and again, and stay the course, you have to spot; your gaze has to be your anchor. Now that I can't perform pirouettes, fouettés, posés en dehors or en dedans—or even the curiously named "lame duck"—I wonder where my gaze has landed, what is anchoring me. I miss the controlled disorientation of turning, fitting a full rotation or two or three into a beat of music, and landing it on time. There is nothing more validating than your own body obeying your mind, surpassing it, moving faster than thought. I picture myself as I am turning, a blurred outline, the color of my leotard blending with my tights, skin, hair. A mirage of myself, evading categorization and fixity, impossible to pin down. Illegible. Is this another form of freedom?

A week has gone by since I lay on the operating table, talking about In-N-Out before losing consciousness. That was the part I was most afraid of: disappearing, a forced sleep. But in the end, it's the before-and-after that are the worst. Before, the anticipation, the horror of the forthcoming dissolution of control, of one's body lying prone on a surgical table, being kept alive by strangers manipulating a breathing tube down one's throat. After, the pain at the site of incision, the temporary inability to do anything for oneself, the diffuse ache from inactivity, the strange loneliness that at times feels like a balm. I stare out the window next to my desk, through the pink window film A. and I installed together, see the vines creeping up along it, the leafy tree and fragments of sky beyond. I see myself, writing sentences, immobile except for the movement of my fingers, my head turning toward the window, my hand reaching out to drink a sip of water.

I think of the lost dream Reeboks, the current moving, invisible, beneath the river. The whirling image of myself, the tear that is now gone, flesh binding to bone. Nothing is the same—I haven't left my house for a week, and yet my body is replacing its own cells, growing new skin. The new order might be made of these things: a string of sentences, a glass of water, a window view, the renewed ability to walk. The world generally going on.

I want to get comfortable here on the spacious side of exile, to wait for evening and lie in bed between A. and H. and the narwhal, the new and old faces, their dark hair, orange and blue fur. To occupy, with abandon, the freedom of the mundane. To get my body from one place to another. At the end of the sentence, empty space.`,

    content: `His body convulses under you and his husband screams, scrambling from his perch in the corner of the room. After that, it's all hands. His husband's hands. Your hands. The hands of his body flailing, searching. For you? For his husband? For God? The noises pass through you. You fall. The bedframe slices a layer of skin from your hip. Your spine hits the floor. Then your head hits the floor. The room spins. Kaleidoscopic. Three naked men. A circus of fumbling limbs. 
	His husband is on top now, scooping his head onto a pillow. His husband whispers to his shaking body. His husband begs for the seizure to end. Foam pools at the edges of his mouth. His eyes roll back in his skull. A voice—internal or external—calls for an ambulance. You find your phone in the pocket of your jeans. 
	Or rather, you find his phone in the pocket of his jeans.
	You spend too long putting in the wrong password before you realize your mistake. The phone shuts down. It knows it doesn't belong to you. 
	Nothing belongs to you. Not the phone. Not the bed. Not the sheets. Not one single thread in their multi-count family. Not the smiling faces in the wedding photos or the memories of the wedding or memories of a wedding of your own. 
	Your sister had warned you about this when you left. She said there would be nothing for you in this city. That you would tire of it all: the strange bodies and the being alone. 
Elsewhere, in a familiar town, she must be preparing to trek from her apartment building to wait with Nadia, and Bea, and Sean—the stay-at-home dad—on the corner where the bus drops their children off after school. Or else, she is just getting home from the Food Lion or from yoga or from visiting your mother, unraveling herself from your father's old army jacket, fixing her hands over the radiator, thawing. Or else, she is alone. Leaning back into her sofa with its busted springs, grateful for this small moment, before husband and daughter come barreling back into her life—a life always so full, even when she is by herself. 
	The body on the bed slows. A final shutter works its way from his head through his legs and out his toes. A sulfurous smell perfumes the room. 
His husband leans back, bare ass floating just over the bed, and releases a long, defeated sigh. His husband's expression is impossible to read as he turns to stare at you, still straddling his partner, limp curls of chest hair as grey as anything outside. 
Like his husband, he is older than he looked in his pictures online. But then, you are, too. In the pictures you are smiling, full to bursting—a college student spread amongst peers. In truth, you are nearing thirty with too much time before you. 
You rest your head against the window. Outside, it has started to snow. 
When you were much younger and your father was still alive and your mother left the house frequently and your sister loved you fiercely, you ventured down to the capital, the four of you, to visit the museums there, and snow flew against the windows of the train in tiny, perfect exclamations, and when you were older and your father had given up and your mother had turned fearful of the way life can change and your sister loved her daughter more fiercely than anyone, you ran barefoot through the neighborhood to see how far you could go, kicking half-melted snowmen who exploded in dirty, slushy bursts, and now, when you are as old as you've ever been, and your father is gone and your mother has retreated and your sister forgets to return your calls, you find yourself, frozen, in this quiet, tidy room, as the beginnings of a snowstorm soften the edges of a late afternoon, listening for the hot flash of a stranger's breathing. 
Suppose the worst; could you fill the void left behind? 
There isn't time to ask. The body on the bed stirs. His eyes reopen. 
Immediately, the two cling to one another, gasping into each other's open mouths, trading breath in a language they will not share. They have sidestepped tragedy and you, a voyeur to the resurrection, become object, observer, and, wordlessly, are expelled from their lives, still buttoning your clothes. 
Behind a shroud of clouds, the dull pulse of a winter's sun beats. You pause on the stoop, hand at your collar, your own breath dancing away from you. Snow gathers on the street, momentarily undisturbed. The sidewalks are empty in either direction. 
Thirteen: A boy who has slept in the bunk above you all summer long shimmies the elastic waistband of his swimsuit down the blunt, straight lines of his hips. You touch him until he, too, shakes, like a tree losing its leaves for the first time. Afterward, you wipe a sticky hand across the back of your legs, and he tells you neither of you were ever there.`,
